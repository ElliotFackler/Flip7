My goal with this project is to simulate the beloved card game Flip 7 by Eric Olson. My soon to be family-in-law introduced me to this game and I find it very enjoyable. 
I have attached a pdf copy of the rules in the repository.

My TODO list for this project;
1. Finish building out functionality for player
2. Build the NPC functionality
3. Add AI for the NPC so it can play
